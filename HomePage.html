    <p>Welcome to N.D. Bakery! We are a small, family owned bakery buisness in Greensboro, North Carolina.
        Our buisness was started out of our love for baking, and our passion for sharing delicious foods with others.
        We sell a variety of decadent, homemade items made from scratch. We also take custom orders!
        We hope you can take some time to browse our selection and maybe even place an order! From our kitchen to yours,
        happy snacking!
